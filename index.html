    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Chihiro has gotten lost in the spirit world and she must make her way back home! <br>
    In order for Chihiro to survive this journey she must eat food from the spirit realm <br>
    By eating this food it allows her to remain invisible to the spirits and she cannot be seen <br>
    She must get across the bridge safely by avoiding the spirits and eating food along the way <br>
    If she succesfully crosses the bridge without been detected Chihiro will be safe from harm <br>
    There is a timer that will show how long it will take her to get to the end <br>
    However, there are some special foods which will drop from time to time which will take <br>
    Time away from the timer, which by doing so it will help you win the game faster. <br>
    <br>
    You may use the left and the right arrow keys on your keyboard in order to make Chihiro move.</p>
